# Development Blog
This is the source for my development blog [Devyn.Cyphers.io](http://devynCyphers.io).
It uses Angular 2/Firebase and is build using Angular-cli.
I have used other setups for ng2 projects (one with grunt/systemjs/yo, and another with the old cli/Horizon ) but they were harder to use than this setup. This combination just works.

## Badges
I have used TeamCity before but have been wanting to try some 'CI as a Service' options, Mainly Travis Ci and Codeship. I am using Travis CI in another project so This one is done with Codeship.
